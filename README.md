1. Database Creation

Technology: MongoDB
Schema Design:
dishId (unique identifier)
dishName (string)
imageUrl (string)
isPublished (boolean)
Implementation:
Connected to MongoDB using Mongoose.
Created a Dish model.
Populated the database with initial JSON data.

2. API Development
Technology: Node.js, Express
Endpoints:
GET /api/dishes: Fetches the list of dishes.
PUT /api/dishes/:dishId/publish: Toggles the isPublished status of a dish.
Implementation:
Set up an Express server.
Created routes to handle fetching and updating dish data.
Connected the routes to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.

3.Front-End Dashboard

Technology: React.js, Axios
Features:
Displays all dishes with their information.
Includes a button to toggle the published status of each dish.
Implementation:
Created React components (App, DishList, DishItem).
Fetched data from the backend using Axios.
Implemented state management to handle dish updates and re-renders.

4.Real-Time Updates

Technology: WebSockets (Socket.io)
Implementation:
Set up a WebSocket server on the backend.
Established a WebSocket connection on the frontend.
Emitted events from the server to the client to update the dashboard in real-time.

Key Points:
Database: MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility in handling JSON-like documents and ease of integration with Node.js.
Backend: Express provided a simple and efficient framework for building RESTful APIs.
Frontend: React.js allowed for a modular and responsive user interface, making it easy to manage and update the state based on user interactions.
Real-Time Updates: WebSockets ensured that changes made to the dish data were reflected on the dashboard in real-time, providing a seamless user experience.

Challenges and Solutions:
Database Connectivity: Ensured reliable connection and data integrity by handling errors and using appropriate Mongoose methods.
API Consistency: Maintained a consistent and clear API design, making it easy for the frontend to interact with the backend.
State Management: Used React hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage and update the state efficiently.
Real-Time Communication: Implemented WebSockets to keep the client updated with the latest changes from the server.

Conclusion:
This solution demonstrates a full-stack application with a well-structured backend and a dynamic frontend.
The use of modern technologies like React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB ensures scalability and maintainability.
Real-time updates provide an enhanced user experience, making this dish management application a robust and interactive platform.
